# Parallel Customer Request Processing
Description

This project demonstrates the concept of multithreading in Java by creating multiple threads to run concurrent tasks. Each thread executes a simple task that simulates a long-running operation using Thread.sleep().

Features

Creates multiple threads dynamically.

Each thread runs independently.

Simulates real-world parallel processing using Runnable.

Uses exception handling for interrupted threads.

Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 19 or later.

NetBeans IDE or any Java-compatible IDE.


How to Run

1) Open the project in your preferred IDE.

2) Compile the project using:
   javac Main.java

3) Run the project using:
   java Main

Code Overview

  Main class: Initializes and starts multiple threads.
  
  Task class: Implements Runnable and defines the logic for each thread.
  
  Each task prints its execution details and sleeps for 2 seconds before completing.

Expected Output

  Upon execution, the program will start three threads that print their execution status. The output may appear in a different order due to concurrent execution.
  Example
    ðŸ”¹ Task 2 is running on thread: Thread-1
    ðŸ”¹ Task 1 is running on thread: Thread-0
    ðŸ”¹ Task 3 is running on thread: Thread-2
    âœ… Task 3 is finished.
    âœ… Task 2 is finished.
    âœ… Task 1 is finished.

    
Possible Improvements

  Implementing a thread pool for better resource management.
  
  Using Callable and Future for returning results from threads.
  
  Adding user input to determine the number of threads dynamically.
